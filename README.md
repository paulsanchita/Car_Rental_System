##  Car Rental System
Immerse yourself in the dynamic world of car rentals with the Car Rental System, a sophisticated Java-based console application that seamlessly blends education and simulation. 
This innovative platform empowers users to effortlessly rent and return vehicles, manage comprehensive customer records, and meticulously track rental histories.
This project also practically shows the OOPs concept.

## Features

1. Rent a Car 
2. Return a Car
3. Car Management
4. Rental History

## Future Scope

1. Support multiple customers renting the same car simultaneously.
2. Implement date-based pricing adjustments.
3. Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) for enhanced user experience.
4. Integrate online booking and payment systems.
5. Generate detailed reports and analytics for rental trends and customer behavior.

## Concepts and Technologies Used

## 1. Java Programming Language
- **Description**: The entire application is developed using Java.

### 2. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

### 3. Collection Framework
- **ArrayList**: Used to manage collections of `Car`, `Customer`, and `Rental` objects. The `ArrayList` class from Java's Collection Framework is employed to dynamically handle lists of these objects.

### 4. Exception Handling
- **Scanner Input Handling**: The code uses `Scanner` to handle user inputs from the console. Proper input handling and validation ensure the system runs smoothly without crashing due to invalid user inputs.

### 5. User Interface
- **Console-Based UI**: The application uses a simple console-based user interface to interact with the user. The `Scanner` class is used for reading user inputs, and `System.out.println` is used for displaying options and messages to the user.

### 6. Conditional Logic and Loops
- **Conditionals**: Used to check availability of cars and validate user inputs.
- **Loops**: `while` loops and `for` loops are used to iterate over the list of cars and rentals, and to keep the menu running until the user decides to exit.

### 7. Custom Methods
- Methods like `addCar`, `addCustomer`, `rentCar`, `returnCar`, and `menu` are created to encapsulate specific functionalities, making the code more modular and easier to understand.
